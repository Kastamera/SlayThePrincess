# Known issues:
- The Chained card enhancement renders under the rank and the symbols on the cards (The Cage)
- When selling the Beast outside a round, the card will be added to an invisible hand

# Balance changes needed:
Shifting Mound is too weak for a Legendary
Apotheosis is (potentially?) too strong
Not enough econ
Fury and Mutual almost same mechanic
